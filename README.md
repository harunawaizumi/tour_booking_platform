## Project

"Jimoto", which is a local tour providing platform based in Tokyo.

## Concept

Local guides create their own tours like "Fish market tour", "Amine tour", and "Night walking tour" etc.
Travelers from outside of Japan book a tour they are interested in, share the tour with others to devide the price, and enjoy the sightseeing with other travelers and local guides.

## Motivation

```
"How to give strangers from overseas opportunities to enjoy their trip more and talk to local people"
```

This is our original motivation we had.
But we found a problem of this tourism market.

```
"local tour is too expensive. (8h walking tour costs $70 on average for each participant)"
```

Our solution is :

```
Make a platform you can share local tours with other travelres to split the price
```

We realized the price would be one 4th ~ one 5th compared to exisiting price.

## When We worked on
2016/07 ~ 2018/05 (1y10m)

## Target Users

- Guides: `local Japanese who started their career as tour gudie recently`
- Participants: `non-Japanese travelers in Japan who can't speak Japanese, want to join a tour to explore Japan especially Tokyo, but won't pay $70 for that local tour.

## Interviews

We had interviews with potential users multiple times to improve our concept.

1. More than 100 travelers in Japan (in Shinjuku-gyoen, Ueno park)
2. More than 20 local Japanese
