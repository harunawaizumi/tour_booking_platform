## Project

**_Jimoto_**, which is a **local tour providing platform** based in Tokyo.

## Concept

Local guides can create their own unique tours like "Fish market tour", "Amine tour", and "Night walking tour" etc through our platform.
Travelers from outside of Japan get to book a tour they are interested in immediately, share the tour and divide the guide fees with others, and enjoy the sightseeing with them.

## Motivation

**"Give strangers from overseas opportunities to let them enjoy their trip more and mingle with local people"**

This is our original motivation we had.
But we found a problem in this tourism market.

**Problem:**
Local tour is too expensive. (8h walking tour costs $70 on average for each participant)


**Our solution:**
Make a platform you can share local tours with other travelres to split the price

We assume the price could be 1/4 ~ 1/5 compared to exisiting price.

## When We worked on
2016/07 ~ 2018/05 (1y10m)

## Target Users

- Guides: Local Japanese who started their career as tour guides recently
- Participants: Non-Japanese younger travelers who can't speak Japanese, want to join a tour to explore Japan especially Tokyo.

## Interviews

We had interviews with a lot of travelers and guides multiple times to improve our concept.

1. More than 100 travelers in Japan (in Shinjuku-gyoen, Ueno park)
2. More than 20 local Japanese 


## Feature
