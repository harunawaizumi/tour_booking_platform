## Project

**_Jimoto_**, which is a **local tour providing platform** based in Tokyo.

## Concept

Local guides can create their own unique tours by themselves like "Fish market tour", "Amine tour", and "Night walking tour" etc.
Travelers from outside of Japan get to book a tour they are interested in immidiately, share the tour with others, devide the guide fees, and enjoy the sightseeing with other travelers and a local guide.

## Motivation

> Give strangers from overseas opportunities to let them enjoy their trip more and mingle with local people

This is our original motivation we had.
But we found a problem of this tourism market.

```
Problem: 
**local tour is too expensive. (8h walking tour costs $70 on average for each participant)**
```

```
Our solution :
**Make a platform you can share local tours with other travelres to split the price**
```

We realized the price would be one 4th ~ one 5th compared to exisiting price.
